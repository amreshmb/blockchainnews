        <h2><span id="What_is_Wortheum_news">What is wortheum.news?</span></h2>
        <p>Steemit has redefined jornlism by building a living, breathing, and growing media economy - a community where users are rewarded for sharing their voice. It's a new kind of attention economy.</p>
        <p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a></p>
        <h2><span id="How_does_Wortheum_work">How does Wortheum work?</span></h2>
        <p>Wortheum.news is a web3 news website that are powered by the Wortheum blockchain and WORTH cryptocurrency. All of these websites read and write content to the Wortheum blockchain, which stores the content in an immutable blockchain ledger, and rewards users for their contributions with digital tokens called WORTH.</p>
        <p>Every day, the Wortheum blockchain mints new WORTH tokens and adds them to a community's "rewards pool". These tokens are then awarded to users for their contributions, based on the votes that their content receives. Users who hold more tokens in their account as "Worth Power" will get to decide where a larger portion of the rewards pool is distributed.</p>

        <p>While most news websites/platforms extract this value for the benefit of their shareholders, Wortheum believes that the users of the platform should receive the benefits and rewards for their attention and the contributions they make to the platform.</p>

        <p>Unlike most other websites, <strong>there is no way to recover your account if you lose your password / owner key!</strong> This is why it is extremely important that you save and backup your password somewhere safe. It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity.

        <p>If you leak your private key to another user or a third-party website, that user or website will have full access to your account.

        <p>You can earn digital tokens on Wortheum by:</p>
        <p><strong>Posting</strong> - By sharing your posts, you can earn upvotes from community members. Depending on the upvotes you receive, you may get a portion of the "rewards pool".</p>
        <p><strong>Voting and curating</strong> - If you discover a post and upvote it before it becomes popular, you can earn a curation reward. The reward amount will depend on the amount of Worth Power you have.</p>
        <p><strong>Purchasing</strong> - Users can purchase Worth or Worth Dollar tokens directly through their Wortheum wallet using bitcoin, Ether, or BNB tokens.
        <strong>Vesting</strong> - WORTH tokens that are powered up to Worth Power will earn a small amount of new tokens for holding.</p>
        <p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a></p>
        <h2><span id="Where_do_the_tokens_come_from">Where do the tokens come from?</span></h2>
        <p>The Wortheum network continually creates new digital tokens to reward content creators and curators. Some of the newly-created tokens are transferred to users who add value to Wortheum by posting, commenting, and voting on other people's posts. The remainder is distributed to holders of Worth Power and the witnesses that power the blockchain.</p>
        <p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a></p>
        <h2><span id="Where_does_the_value_come_from">Where does the value come from?</span></h2>
        <p>At its root, Worth is simply a points system. However, because this points system is blockchain-based, the points can be traded on markets as tokens. People buy and sell these tokens, and many hold in anticipation of increased purchasing power for various Wortheum-related services.</p>
        <p>By analogy, Wortheum is a game system where users compete for attention and rewards by bringing content and adding value to the platform. The rewards people earn are tokens that have market value and are readily tradable. It is similar to how someone playing a video game could obtain a limited item or currency by playing the game. If the currency or items are transferable between users, then they can sell or buy them on game item markets.</p>

        <h2><span id="Why_are_people_getting_vastly_different_rewards">Why are people getting vastly different rewards?</span></h2>
        <p>Wortheum is not a "get rich quick" scheme. While it is possible to post content that goes viral quickly and earn a lot of rewards on a single post, this is not typical for most users.</p>
        <p>Most of the authors that you see earning high rewards are users that have spent a lot of time in the network building followings, making connections with others, and developing a reputation for bringing high quality content.</p>
        <p>It is best to have realistic expectations, without focusing on rewards when you are first starting out. Work on building a following, making connections, and developing a good reputation. Consistency will pay off in the long run.</p>

        <p>Verification is a process where users give evidence to show that they are the person that they claim to be.  This is to reduce fraud and people impersonating known figures. If you would like to remain anonymous, that is perfectly fine. However if you claim to be someone specific, the community may expect that you verify you are who you say you are.</p>
        <p>There are a number of ways to do this. The most common way to verify your identity is by posting a link to your Wortheum profile on a website or social media account which you are already known for having such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, a blog, or photography site.</p>
        <p>Many users also like to post a photo or a video which shows them holding up a sheet of paper with the current date and their Wortheum account name handwritten on it. This is a great way to add a personal touch to verifying.</p>

        <p>Blockchains like Wortheum and Bitcoin produce new tokens each time a block is produced. Unlike Bitcoin, where all of the new coins go to the block producers (called miners), the Wortheum blockchain allocates a majority of the new tokens to a reward fund called the "rewards pool". The rewards pool gives users tokens for participating in the platform based on the value they add.</p>

        <p>Starting with the network's 1st hard fork, Wortheum began creating new tokens at a yearly inflation rate of 9.5%. The inflation rate decreases at a rate of 0.01% every 250,000 blocks, or about 0.5% per year. The inflation will continue decreasing at this pace until the overall inflation rate reaches 0.95%. This will take about 20.5 years from the time hard fork 1 went into effect.</p>

        <p>Up to 50% of a post's payout is awarded to curators (the people who upvoted the post) as a reward for discovering the content. The other 50% is awarded to the author.</p>
        <p>If curators vote for a post within the first 5 minutes of it being created, a portion of their curation reward is going back to the reward pool. This portion is linear to the age of the post between 0 and 5 minutes. As an example: upvoting at 15 minutes will donate half of your potential curation reward back to the reward pool.</p>

        <p><strong>Worth Power</strong> - Worth Power (abbreviated WP) is a measurement of how much influence a user has in the Steem network. The more Steem Power a user holds, the more they can influence the value of posts and comments. Worth Power is less liquid. If a user wishes to “Power Down” WP, they will receive equal distributions of the WORTH weekly, over a 13 week period.</p>
        <p><strong>Worth Dollars</strong> - Worth Dollars (commonly abbreviated WBD) are liquid stable-value currency tokens designed to be pegged to $1 USD. Worth Dollars can be traded with WORTH, and transferred to other accounts for commerce or exchange.  Worth Dollars may also be converted into WORTH via a process that takes 3.5 days.</p>

        <p><strong>Powering up</strong> - If you have WORTH tokens, you can Power Up to Worth Power to get more voting influence on posts and comments. Having more Worth Power also increases the amount of curation rewards and new vested tokens that you can earn. More WP also grants more influence on approving Wortheum witnesses.</p>
        <p><strong>Powering down</strong> - If you have Worth Power, you can power down to turn it into liquid WORTH over a period of time. The system will transfer 1/13 of your Worth Power to WORTH each week for about three months (13 weeks), starting 1 week from the time it is started. However, you will lose your influence in the network proportionally to how much is powered down, so think about it carefully. Power downs can be stopped at any time.</p>

        <p>Payouts occur as a combination of Worth Power and Worth Dollars. Sometimes the blockchain may substitute WORTH in place of the Worth Dollars based on market conditions.</p>
        <p>The blockchain estimates the dollar value of WORTH and Worth Power based on the 3.5 day average price of WORTH reported by the witnesses. The blockchain assumes Worth Dollars are worth approximately one USD.</p>

At the end of the 3.5 days, the WBD will be gone and replaced by approximately $1 USD worth of WORTH tokens. The "approximately 1 USD worth of WORTH tokens" is based on the median WORTH price over the 3.5 days, using the price feeds from the Wortheum witnesses. Depending on price fluctuations during the 3.5 days it is possible to end up with more or less than $1 USD worth of WORTH per WBD at the end of the conversion.

        <p>Voting power is like an "energy bar" in a computer game that goes down a little bit every time you vote. You start out with 100% voting power. Every time you vote, you will use a small amount of your voting power.</p>
        <p>As you use more of your voting power, your votes will carry less influence. A vote with 50% voting power left will be worth 1/2 as much as a vote cast with 100% voting power. Not to worry, the network recharges your voting power by 20% every day.</p>

        <p>Every 100% vote you cast will use 2% of your remaining voting power. Your voting power will recharge by 20% each day. You can vote more than 10 times per day, but each vote will be worth less, and it will take longer to reach full voting power again.</p>

        <p>New users can only upvote and downvote with 100% voting strength.</p>
        <p>Once you reach about 500 Worth Power, you will see a vote slider appear when you vote. You can use the slider to adjust the weight of your vote, between 1% and 100% voting strength. Voting with less than 100% voting weight will use up less voting power, but it will also have less of an influence on the post or comment's rewards.</p>

        <p>Of the 50% that goes to the curator, that portion will be split between going back to the reward pool and the curator if the curator votes within the first 5 minutes. The split of the 50% during the first 5 minutes is calculated linearly based on the time the vote is cast.</p>

        <p>A user with more WP is going to have a larger influence on the rewards than users with less WP. One vote from a user with a lot of WP can often have more of an effect than 100 votes from users with a small amount of WP.</p>
        <p>Even though your vote may not have an immediate effect, when it gets added in along with all the other votes at the end of the payout period, it can still affect the payout. It may also cause more users to vote on the post too, because they saw that you upvoted it - so your votes can have an indirect effect on the payout this way.</p>

It’s not to say other variables aren’t important, but reputation will be an enormous factor in your level of success.</p>
        <p>Many Wortheum users glance at users’ reputation scores when deciding which articles to read because they know higher reputation scores means it is much more likely quality content. Furthermore, the higher your rep, the more effect your vote will have on the reputation of others.</p>
        <p>It is worth noting that if your reputation score goes below 0, Wortheum will hide your posts and comments making it very difficult to gain monetary rewards and followers. This incentivizes online etiquette and respect for your fellow users.</p>

        <p>A blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions ever executed. All of the transactions and data are stored in a distributed database. Each time the database is updated, all of updates are done together in a batch called a 'block'. Each time a new block is produced/added, it is appended on to all of the previous blocks - hence the name "blockchain".</p>

        <p>The Wortheum blockchain is the publicly accessible distributed database, which records all posts and votes, and distributes the rewards across the network. It is where all of the text content and voting data is stored, and it is where all of the reward calculations and payouts are performed.</p>

        <h2><span id="How_does_bandwidth_work_on_the_Wortheum_blockchain">How does bandwidth work on the Wortheum blockchain?</span></h2>
        <p>Since transacting on the Wortheum blockchain has zero fees, bandwidth rate-limiting is employed to safeguard the blockchain from spam attacks. Everything action that you take on the blockchain will consume a small amount of bandwidth. This includes posting, commenting, voting, transferring tokens, etc. Viewing content does not consume bandwidth.</p>
        <p>Every user has a limited amount of bandwidth to use each week. The more transactions a user does, the less bandwidth they will have left (until it recharges). Users with more Worth Power will have a higher bandwidth allowance.</p>
        <p>Normally everyone's bandwidth allowance is quite high, and users are able to use the network freely without any interruptions. Sometimes when the blockchain becomes busy however (due to heavy use), everyone's individual allowances may go down until the network becomes less busy.</p>
        <p>If users are below their bandwidth limit, they will be unable to transact with the blockchain until their bandwidth recharges or their limit is raised.</p>
        <p>If you get an error that you have exceeded your bandwidth allowance, it is normally best to just wait and try again later (when it is less busy). Usually if you wait and try again later, the transaction will likley go through.</p>
        <p>If you are unable to transact for extended periods of time, or you are frequently running into bandwidth limits, then you will either need to reduce your usage to stay within your limit.</p>

        <p>On a technical level, the two networks rely on the same model of a blockchain, but are built upon different technologies and codebase. Wortheum is based on a new state-of-the-art blockchain technology called Graphene, which uses "witnesses" instead of "miners" to produce blocks.</p>
        <p>The "delegated proof of stake" model of using witnesses instead of miners allows for greater efficiency in block production. With BTC, 100% of the new coins that are created are allocated to block producers (miners). With the Worth blockchain, only 10% of the new coins are paid to block producers (witnesses). The other 90% of new WORTH coins are awarded to content producers, curators, and Worth Power holders.</p>

        <p><strong>Proof of work</strong> - Miners solve a complex mathematical problem. The miner that solves the problem first adds the block to the blockchain. The network rewards the miner for doing so.</p>
        <p><strong>Proof of stake</strong> - Requires ownership, or stake, in the cryptocurrency. The more tokens you own, the more block creation power you have. Benefits: eliminates the need for expensive mining rigs, runs on a tiny fraction of the power, and it requires block producers to have a stake in the network.</p>
        <p><strong>Delegated proof of stake</strong> - Block-creating accounts, called witnesses, are collectively approved by Worth stakeholders. Instead of relying on proof of work to find blocks, the Worth network actively schedules these accounts to improve the time between blocks to 3 seconds.</p>

        <p>If your password has been changed without your consent, then the account designated as your recovery account can generate a new owner key for the account. The account recovery must be completed within 30 days of the password being changed, and you must supply a recent owner key that was valid within the last 30 days.</p>
        <p><span>Wortheum OU. owns the default recovery account (<a href="/@wortheum">@wortheum</a>) for all users who sign up using wortheum.news. Wortheum can only identify users by their original email, Facebook, or Reddit logins that were used to signup via Wortheum.news.</span></p>
        <p>If you don't have the master password or owner key that was valid the past 30 days, or are unable to prove that you are the original owner of the account, then your account will be unrecoverable.</p>
        <p>The stolen account recovery process can only restore ownership of the account. It is not possible to recover funds that were stolen.</p>

        <h2><span id="What_are_Wortheum_witnesses">What are Wortheum witnesses?</span></h2>
        <p>The Wortheum blockchain requires a set of people to create blocks and uses a consensus mechanism called delegated proof of stake, or DPOS. The community elects 'witnesses' to act as the network's block producers and governance body. There are 20 full-time witnesses, producing a block every 63-second round. A 21st position is shared by the backup witnesses, who are scheduled proportionally to the amount of stake-weighted community approval they have. Witnesses are compensated with Worth Power for each block they create.</p>
