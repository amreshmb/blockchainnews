                other calamity. Consider digital offline storage (such as a
                flash drive or burned CD), secure private cloud-based storage,
                as well as printed paper. Use multiple methods of storage for

              <p>
                To create a post, click on the "Post" link in the upper right
                corner.
              </p>
              <p>Posts have three main parts: Title, Content, and Tags.</p>
              <p>
                You will want to make your title attractive and relevant to your
                content. The first image that you use will become the thumbnail
                image.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can insert images by dragging &amp; dropping, pasting from
                the clipboard, or by selecting them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tags will help people find your posts. Each post can have up to
                five tags, separated by spaces. The tags should all be relevant
                to the content in the post. You can browse content by tags, as
                well as see a list of popular tags that other users have used in
                their posts <a href="https://wortheum.news/tags">here</a>. The
                first tag becomes the post's category and cannot be changed
                later.

                The projected payments may fluctuate (up and down) until the

                Payments for posts are split between the author (at least 50%)
